# Artemis-Financial-Security-Portfolio
# CS 305 Module Eight Journal

## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements.
Artemis Financial, a prominent financial services company, sought assistance in enhancing the security of their software systems. The goal is to identify and overcome vulnerabilities that could compromise the integrity and confidentiality of their sensitive financial information. The main concern of the customers is that their software applications are tightly fortified against cyber threats, protecting the trust of their customers and the reputation of the company.

## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
During the process of identifying software security vulnerabilities, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the codebase, using a combination of manual code review and automated security scanning tools. This approach ensured a thorough examination of potential weaknesses. Coding securely is of paramount importance as it shields software applications from cyberattacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches. This, in turn, maintains customer trust, prevents financial loss, and safeguards the company's reputation. The value of software security extends beyond immediate protection, contributing to long-term business sustainability.

## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was identifying subtle vulnerabilities that could be overlooked by automated tools. Manual analysis and understanding of potential attack vectors were necessary. The helpful aspect was the utilization of automated security scanning tools, which efficiently pinpointed common vulnerabilities, allowing me to focus on intricate issues requiring deeper analysis.

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I enhanced security by implementing various measures such as the utilization of AES-256 encryption, SHA-256 checksums, secure communication through HTTPS, and integrating secure coding practices. In the future, I will use security tools development, manual code analysis, and penetration testing to assess vulnerabilities. I will also select mitigation measures based on the severity of the vulnerability, the potential impact, and the specifics of the software.

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured the code's functionality and security through meticulous testing. This included unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests. After refactoring, I performed another round of security testing, including manual code review and penetration testing. Additionally, I utilized tools like the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven to scrutinize new dependencies for potential vulnerabilities.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
In this project, I effectively used tools like Burp Suite, OWASP Dependency-Check Maven, and practices such as secure coding guidelines from OWASP. These resources and tools will certainly be valuable in future assignments, ensuring thorough security assessment and robust software development.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
From this assignment, I can showcase my adeptness at conducting vulnerability assessments, identifying security vulnerabilities, and implementing robust security measures. I can demonstrate my proficiency in secure coding practices, knowledge of encryption algorithms, and ability to maintain software functionality while enhancing security. This project serves as tangible evidence of my capacity to address real-world security challenges, assuring potential employers of my competence in securing software applications effectively.
